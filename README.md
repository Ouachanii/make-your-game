# Make Your Game

ðŸŽ® **Make Your Game** is a single-player Bomberman-inspired game built entirely with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSSâ€”no frameworks, no canvas, just pure DOM manipulation. The project features a custom game engine and tools, designed from scratch to deliver smooth, consistent 60 FPS gameplay and a fully responsive experience across devices.

## Features

- **60 FPS Animation:** Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for buttery-smooth motion and consistent frame rates.
- **Performance Diagnostics:** Built-in FPS counter, frame time stats, and dropped frame warnings for real-time performance monitoring.
- **Responsive Design:** The game grid and UI scale seamlessly to any screen size, from desktop to mobile.
- **Pause Menu:** Pause, continue, or restart the game at any time with a clean overlay menu.
- **Scoreboard:** Real-time display of score, remaining lives, and a countdown timer.
- **Keyboard Controls:** Play entirely with the keyboard. Hold movement keys for smooth, continuous motionâ€”no key spamming required.
- **Minimal DOM Layers:** Optimized rendering with minimal DOM nesting for best performance.
- **Custom Levels:** Increasingly challenging levels with unique layouts and enemy placements.
- **No Frameworks or Canvas:** 100% native JS, HTML, and CSS.

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys:** Move the player.
- **Spacebar:** Place a bomb.
- **P:** Pause the game.
- **R** Restart the game.

## How It Works

- The game board is rendered as a CSS Grid, with each cell, player, enemy, bomb, and explosion represented by a DOM element.
- All movement and animations are handled via `transform: translate(...)` for maximum performance.
- The game loop is driven by `requestAnimationFrame`, and the timer uses `setInterval` for countdown logic.
- The game state is managed in a single `GAME_DATA` object, making it easy to reset or update the game.
